     # Describe the difference between is.finite(x) and !is.infinite(x).
     # ANSWER: THEY RETURN THE SAME VALUE
     
     # Read the source code for dplyr::near() (Hint: to see the source code, drop the ()). How does it work?
      # ANSWER: It takes in to vectors to compare and checks to see if they equate to within a similar range. If so, then it returns that they are equal
       
       # A logical vector can take 3 possible values. How many possible values can an integer vector take? How many possible values can a double take? Use google to do some research.
       # ANSWER: Integer Vector = +/-2*10^9; double vector = 2e-308 to 2e+308
     
     # Brainstorm at least four functions that allow you to convert a double to an integer. How do they differ? Be precise.
